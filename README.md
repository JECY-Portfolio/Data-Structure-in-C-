## Overview

This repository contains implementation of three data structures: LinkedList<T>, Stack<T>, and Queue<T> in C#. Each data structure is generic and can be used with any data type.


## Features

LinkedList<T> Class
A singly linked list with the following methods:

Add(T item): Adds an item to the list.

Remove(T item): Removes the first occurrence of an item.

Check(T item): Checks if an item exists in the list.

Index(T item): Returns the index of an item.

Size(): Returns the number of items in the list.

LastNode(): Returns the last node in the list.


Stack<T> Class
A stack implemented using a linked list with the following methods:

IsEmpty(): Checks if the stack is empty.

Push(T item): Adds an item to the stack.

Pop(): Removes and returns the top item of the stack.

Peek(): Returns the top item without removing it.

Size(): Returns the number of items in the stack.


Queue<T> Class
A queue implemented using a linked list with the following methods:

IsEmpty(): Checks if the queue is empty.

Enqueue(T item): Adds an item to the queue.

Dequeue(): Removes and returns the front item of the queue.

Size(): Returns the number of items in the queue.

## This implementation offers flexible and simple usage of linked lists, stacks, and queues in C#.

## How to run

Open the project in Visual Studio or any C# IDE. Compile and run the program.
